# LineCounter
Count your lines of code using this small python script

Not an avid python user, so the code is probably not very pythonic.

## Usage
You can enter the desired path to a directory or file via a command line argument.
If you choose not to do this, you will be prompted for a path. Any further command
line arguments will be ignored (at least for right now). Use the argument "--help"
for info at the command line.
